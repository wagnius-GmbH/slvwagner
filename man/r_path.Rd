\title{Convert Windows file path to R compatible file path}
\usage{
r_path(path = "clipboard")
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{Either "clipboard" to read from clipboard, or a character string containing a file path.
Default is "clipboard".}
}
\value{
Character vector of R compatible file path with forward slashes
}
\description{
Copy a Windows file path to your clipboard and call the function to convert backslashes to forward slashes.
The converted path is returned and (on Windows) automatically copied back to your clipboard.
}
\details{
On Windows, the function reads from and writes to the clipboard automatically.
On macOS, it uses \code{pbpaste} to read from clipboard (writing to clipboard is not supported).
On Linux, it uses \code{xclip} to read from clipboard (must be installed, writing not supported).

If you're on Linux and want clipboard support, install xclip:
\code{sudo apt-get install xclip}
}
\examples{
\donttest{
# Windows: Copy a path to clipboard first, then run:
if (.Platform$OS.type == "windows") {
  utils::writeClipboard("C:\\\\Windows")
  r_path()
}

# Provide a path directly (works on all platforms)
r_path("C:\\\\Windows")
r_path("C:/Windows")
r_path("D:/My Documents/file.txt")

# Example with network path
r_path("\\\\\\\\server\\\\share\\\\folder")
}
}
