\title{Convert R path to windows compatible path}
\usage{
r_win_path(path = "clipboard", write_back = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{Either "clipboard" to read from clipboard (Windows only), or a character string
containing a file path. Default is "clipboard".}

\item{write_back}{Logical; if TRUE, copy result back to clipboard (Windows only). Default is TRUE.}
}
\value{
Character vector of Windows-compatible path with backslashes
}
\description{
Convert an R-style path (with forward slashes) to Windows-style (with backslashes).
On Windows, can optionally read from and write to clipboard.
}
\details{
On Windows, when path = "clipboard", the function reads from and optionally writes back to the clipboard.
On macOS/Linux, the clipboard functionality is disabled and you must provide a path directly.

For Linux clipboard support, install xclip: \code{sudo apt-get install xclip}
}
\examples{
\donttest{
# Basic conversion with direct input (works on all platforms)
r_win_path(tempdir())
r_win_path("/home/user/documents/file.txt")

# Windows-only clipboard examples
if (.Platform$OS.type == "windows") {
  # Copy a path to clipboard first, then convert
  utils::writeClipboard("C:/Windows")
  r_win_path()

  # Convert without writing back to clipboard
  r_win_path("C:/Windows", write_back = FALSE)
}
}
}
