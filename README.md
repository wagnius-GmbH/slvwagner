My R library, including all functions I use very often.

Some function need yacas a symbolic solver: \

## Usage
If you just want to use the package you can download the latest release and install a binary or a source package. If you use the source package (.tar.gz) you also need to install rtools to compile.

Another easy way to install: <br>
devtools::install_git("https://github.com/wagnius-GmbH/slvwagner/")
