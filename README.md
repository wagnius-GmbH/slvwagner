### Geometrical stuff 
Functions start with geo_

-   conic section 
-   slerp 
-   Intersection of sphere and line, 
-   Intersecting point(s) of plane and line
-   get parameter from a plane equation (coordinate form)

### Math 
Functions start with math_

-   Transformation from spherical to Cartesian coordinate system and back. 
-   Rotation Matrix in R and Ryacas (YACAS)
-   lf Linear function helpers 
-   math_ Quadrant and angle finder for 2D vector

-   Magnitude of vector 
-   In-between angel of two vectors

#### Math in yacas 
Functions start with yac_

-   rotation matrix 2D
-   rotation matrix 3D
-   Plane coordinate function
-   Intersection plane and line

#### Linear function helper
Functions start with lf_

- perpendicular to function 
- intersection point of two functions
- linear function from two points

### Utilities
Functions start with r_

-   r_ R utility functions, e.g. windows path to R compatible path

### Fast dictionary in R
Function start with dict_
